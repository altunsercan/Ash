h1. Ash: An entity framework for Actionscript games

Ash is an Actionscript 3 entity framework for game development (by Richard Lord)
I decided to post my modifications and utility classes as i develop with it.

h2. Utilities

h3. EntityBuilder

EntityBuilder is a configurable factory class that helps creating entities. There is a build from object feature where new entity recieves values from original object. I am hoping this will help converting object from other libraries to Ash entities.
